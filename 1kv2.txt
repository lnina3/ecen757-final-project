This paper has described a new state-machine replication
algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults and can
be used in practice: it is the first to work correctly in
an asynchronous system like the Internet and it improves
the performance of previous algorithms by more than an
order of magnitude.
The paper also described BFS, a Byzantine-fault-
tolerant implementation of NFS. BFS demonstrates that
it is possible to use our algorithm to implement real
services with performance close to that of an unreplicated
service â€” the performance of BFS is only 3% worse than
that of the standard NFS implementation in Digital Unix.
This good performance is due to a number of important
optimizations, including replacing public-key signatures
by vectors of message authentication codes, reducing
the size and number of messages, and the incremental
checkpoint-management techniques.
