Strategy 2: T random tokens per node and equal sized partitions:
In this strategy, the hash space is divided into Q equally sized
partitions/ranges and each node is assigned T random tokens. Q is
usually set such that Q >> N and Q >> S*T, where S is the
number of nodes in the system. In this strategy, the tokens are
only used to build the function that maps values in the hash space
to the ordered lists of nodes and not to decide the partitioning. A
partition is placed on the first N unique nodes that are encountered
while walking the consistent hashing ring clockwise from the end
of the partition. Figure 7 illustrates this strategy for N=3. In this
example, nodes A, B, C are encountered while walking the ring
from the end of the partition that contains key k1. The primary
advantages of this strategy are: (i) decoupling of partitioning and
partition placement, and (ii) enabling the possibility of changing
the placement scheme at runtime.
