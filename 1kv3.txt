This paper describes a lock service called Chubby. It is
intended for use within a loosely-coupled distributed sys-
tem consisting of moderately large numbers of small ma-
chines connected by a high-speed network. For example,
a Chubby instance (also known as a Chubby cell) might
serve ten thousand 4-processor machines connected by
1Gbit/s Ethernet. Most Chubby cells are confined to a
single data centre or machine room, though we do run
at least one Chubby cell whose replicas are separated by
thousands of kilometres.
The purpose of the lock service is to allow its clients
to synchronize their activities and to agree on basic in-
formation about their environment. The primary goals
included reliability, availability to a moderately large set
of clients, and easy-to-understand semantics; through-
put and storage capacity were considered secondary.
Chubbyâ€™s client interface is similar to that of a simple file
system that performs whole-file reads and writes, aug-
mented with advisory locks and with notification of var-
ious events such as file modification.
